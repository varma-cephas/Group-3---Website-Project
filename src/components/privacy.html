        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
        high priority for the management of the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the
        Agentur Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants
        to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.
        If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
        generally obtain consent from the data subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a
        data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
        accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur Baumeister.
        By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of
        the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
        subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are
        entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous technical and organizational
        measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
        However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection
        may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via
        alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
